Graphics folder:

'filltest' means that there are green bars in the animations, meant to show which items are being checked/moved
Repeat files:

'rpt' in front of a file means I added a repeating time-logger, which I used to log my data more efficiently.
the repeat folder and all its contents were only meant for data collection, and have been largely stripped as a result.
Misc.

a 'simple' file is one that I have gone through and simplified as my understanding progressed
