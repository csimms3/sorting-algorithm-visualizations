# Sorting Algorithm Visualizations

This project includes implementations of various common sorting algorithms, as well as a way to visualize their operations through animations.
This project was created with the goal of explaining the different ways in which sorting algorithms achieve the same task, as part of my grade 12 Career Capstone project.
