# Sorting Algorithm Visualization and Analysis

This is the code portion of my grade 12 career capstone project. This project looks at the development/optimization of sorting algorithms. While several more complex algorithms (mergesort,heapsort,etc.) were copied from the internet, all the animations/simpler algorithms were hand-coded.

Graphics folder:
'filltest' means that there are green bars in the animations, meant to show which items are being checked/moved

Repeat files:
'rpt' in front of a file means I added a repeating time-logger, which I used to log my data more efficiently.
the repeat folder and all its contents were only meant for data collection, and have been largely stripped as a result.

Misc.
a 'simple' file is one that I have gone through and simplified as my understanding progressed
